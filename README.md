# Ecoli_mRNA_gene_grouping_into_leading_and_lagging_strand_and_visualization_of_the_data
Ecoli mRNA gene grouping into leading and lagging strand using python and visualization of the data using R. Here we are given a task to separate 1300 mRNA gene sequences into groups of their position in leading and lagging strand.
grouping using python/1300_gene --> our required 1300 genes of Ecole
grouping using python/4000_gene_coordinates --> all 4000 genes of Ecole with their coordinates and different data
grouping using python/program --> a python program which compares the genes in the file named 1300_gene with the genes in the file named 4000_gene_coordinates and prints the name, starting coordinate, and ending coordinate, and based on these two it also identifies whether it is in a leading strand or lagging strand
visualization using R/result2 --> an Excel file that contains the results we get from the Python program
visualization using R/data_visualization --> A R program that visualizes the data in the result2 file into boxplot, bar chart, and pie chart
Las & Les files of Ecole --> the gene sequence files of Ecole.
